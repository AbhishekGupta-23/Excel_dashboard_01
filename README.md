# Excel_dashboard_01
This is my first excel project, made by creating charts and dashboards.
I have done this project from the coursera platform as a guided project.
From this project, the insights i developed are from the sales data from different categories like, from the salesperson and from the city and from the month of the year and lastly from the category of products.
I obtained this project by using Micorsoft Excel app. In this guided project i have used some of the excel features for the Visualization part
For Visualization i have used several charts and there are pie charts, bar charts, line charts. and some foramttiing featurs 
In this way i have finished the project and obtained some confidence to create dashboards in Excel.
